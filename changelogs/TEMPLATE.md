## Tips for Writing

**Focus on the player experience:**
- ✅ "Added ability to undo stone placement"
- ✅ "Fixed stones disappearing when zooming out"
- ✅ "Improved visibility of the scoring zones"
- ❌ "Refactored CSS variables" (players don't care)
- ❌ "Updated dependencies" (not user-facing)

**Be clear and concise:**
- Use simple language
- One line per change
- Start with a verb (Added, Fixed, Changed, Improved)
- Describe what changed, not how it was implemented

**Order matters:**
- Most important changes first
- Group similar changes together
