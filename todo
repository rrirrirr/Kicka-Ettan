-take the role of an expert in ux and ui. look through the frontend and try to formulate the feel of the website in terms of design. what does the spacings, colors, roundings, typography, animations, etc. make the user feel. write a style guide.
-now take the role of an expert design systems and colors and ux/ui person. look through the frontend and look at how we use colors. list what colors we use and what the meaning of each color is. how do the colors fit in our design system. then look for inconsistencies when it comes to color use and what color should be changed and colors to add. add new findings to the style guide.
-take the role of an expert design systems and ux/ui person. look through the frontend and look for inconsistencies when it comes to styling. spacing, typography, buttons, titles, colors, fonts, text. add new findings to style guide.
-take the role of an expert animations and ux/ui person. look through the frontend code and look for how we can be more consistent with animations and what animations we can add and where. it should feel snappy with a modern and fun feeling with nice easings. it should feel fun to use this app but animations should not be overwhelming. we are looking for a consistent feel. animations should be reusable. this app will mostly be used on phones and tablets, we should have this in mind. add new findings to style guide.

(opus) take the role of a senior developer and testing expert. look through frontend looking for tests we should add.

consistency with title and button styles and fonts and text
too much empty space between settings title and content?
better icons for broom and stone
only show icons/measurements available in the measurement step indicator
add tooltips for stuff
add tooltip/dialog for first time info
close/open stone indicator
new bar with measurement toggles. toggle mode and inspector?
more animations for dialogs/tooltips
loading game anim is on the left of screen. make it centered and make an animation with a red dot
change pointer when hovering over draggable stone

bug:
toggle measurement mode active when not toggled on. it does not use the settings
measurement does not follow metric/imperial setting when smart units are turned on
text should be a bit bigger in toggle measurement mode on
move down the percentage for non brace part for guard measurement. place it around 50% of non brace part
